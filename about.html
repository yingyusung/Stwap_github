      <p> STWAP is a platform created by students to enhance student experience, whilst cutting down on waste. A mobile and online selling, buying and swapping tool for all your needs. We aim to provide a safe way to sell all your unwanted goods. Looking to de-clutter? Swap your goods for something great. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.</p>
      <p> A common goal of ours is to cut down on wastage and plastic packaging. There is so much yet to be done, nonetheless we can make small changes in our everyday life to combat the bigger issues. As a student it seems like an impossible task to make a change, especially when lacking in time and funds. However, we want to provide a service that can simultaneously allow students to sell their unwanted products, make some money and reduce waste, whilst finding the items perfect for them, that are unwanted by other students and so on. Eventually, creating a community of students.</p>
      <p> We also want to provide a safe space for students.  Somewhere where you can get help and advice, from post or current students, about personal or day to day problems.  Univeristy related or if you just want a chat.</p>
      <p> (: Happy shopping :) </p>
